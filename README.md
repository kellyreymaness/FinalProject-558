# FinalProject-558

My final project for ST558 is an app that allows for exploration & analysis of NFL & Fantasy Football statistics. The following packages were installed and used to run this app: shiny, readr, dplyr, ggplot2, plotly, & caret.

#Code to install the necessary packages to run this app: 
install.packages(c("shiny", "readr", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "plotly", "caret"))  

#Code to run this app from RStudio: 
shiny::runGitHub("FinalProject-558", "kellyreymaness", ref = "main")
